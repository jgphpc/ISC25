Accelerating the Visualization Toolkit for Massively Threaded Architectures
is a toolkit of scientific visualization algorithms for emerging
processor architectures. VTK-m supports the fine-grained concurrency for
data analysis and visualization algorithms required to drive extreme scale
computing by providing abstract models for data and execution that can be
applied to a variety of algorithms across many different processor
architectures.
 VTK-m is being discontinued, Viskores is its successor.
